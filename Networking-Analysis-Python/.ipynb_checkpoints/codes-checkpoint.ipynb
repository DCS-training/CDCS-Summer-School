    "A social network can contain millions of users. Some of these users are more active or more powerful than other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to measure the structural importance of nodes in the network? \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Degree centrality**: the number of connections (edges) to other users as the measure of importance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Betweenness centrality** describes how important a user is as a link between different network segments\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Identifying bridges/brokerages\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - \"Structural holes\": An individual who acts as a mediator between two or more closely connected groups of people could gain important comparative advantages. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eigenvector centrality** measurement describes the centrality of a person with regard to the global structure of the network. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to nodes with high scoring contrib- ute more to the score of the node in question than connections to nodes with low scoring.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **PageRank**, which is a variant of the eigenvector centrality measure\n",
    "\n",
    "    - According to PageRank algorithm, the importance of a page is determined by the importance of the pages that it is linked to. A page is assigned a high rank if the sum of the ranks of its back- links is high. Otherwise, it is assigned a low rank.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - PageRank algorithm gives nontrivial results only for asymmetric networks. If links are symmetric (undirected), the PageRank values will be the same as node degrees.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - PageRank was proposed to index Web pages. However, it can also be applied to calculate centrality for directed graphs in social networks."
