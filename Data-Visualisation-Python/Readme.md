# Data Visualisation with Python

In this workshop, we will cover some of the basic ways of visualising data in Python. We will continue to use pandas dataframes and introduce the library of Matplotlib. We will focus on plot types such as line plots, bar plots, area plots, and histograms. We will also learn how to modify various features such as the labels in the horizontal and vertical axis, the style of the plot, the colours, etc., and perform some annotations to our plots. If we have time we will see how to create various subplots so we can plot various figures simultaneously.
