## Installation

In this workshop, we are going to use the following packages, please run the following codes in your terminals before the course. 

You will need to install ```pip``` in your local envrionment before the installation. 

Here's a documentation on installing pip: <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>

```

pip install -U spacy
pip install --upgrade gensim
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
pip install pillow
pip install wordcloud
```

## Course Materials

```slides.ipynb``` has both the codes and outputs from running the code cells mentioned in the lecture

```slides.html``` is a jupyter-generated slides for you (for future references)

```codes.ipynb``` has all the codes mentioned in the lecture but contains no outputs, please use this jupyter notebook file to run codes during the course.

Please find the dataset saved in the **data** folder, and related readings in the **reading** folder

For your convenience, you can also download from the following link: https://github.com/DCS-training/CDCS-Summer-School/tree/main/Zipped-Files. The contents are identical.

## If you can't install any of the above-mentioned packages in your local environment, you can use ```google colab```

- Step 1: open Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/

- Step 2: searching "DCS-training/CDCS-Summer-School" under the "GitHub" tab

- Step 3: select "Text-Analysis-Python/codes.ipynb" to open in Google Colab

- Step 4: importing the data and image folder 
    - click the "files" icon on the left column of your screen 
    - create an empty folder called "data" 
    - import the csv data file from the data folder downloaded from the current GitHub repo
    - Make sure the data fiel is under the "data" folder on Google Colab
