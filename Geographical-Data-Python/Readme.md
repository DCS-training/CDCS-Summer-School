# Geographical Data with Python 
This block will be divided into two sections from 09:15-11:00 and 11:15-	13:15 on Wednesday the 9th of June.  

The focus will be on Geographical Data, with a basic understanding of python and jupyter notebook assumed.

This block will provide a solid base for understanding Geographical Data Analysis with Python, and will allow attendees to apply and develop the core concepts to their own work and/or research.

## Topics
* Basic understanding of Geographical Data, including vectors, rasters, .shp files and .tif files 
* Plotting simple geographical features 
* The use and differences between basic plot functions and those afforded in geopandas and matplotlib.pyplot 
* Deeper customisation of Geographical data, including labels, colour maps, re-sizing/re-positioning legends and adjusting extent/scale 
* Overlaying Geographical features for more complex analysis 
* Exporting plots
