# CDCS-Summer-School

Welcome to the **CDCS Data and Text analysis Summer School Repo**.
Here you will be able to access all the material and data connected to the school
Each block has its own folder and within each folder you can find a read me file, a data file/folder, and the code that will be used during the class.
In the read me file you will also find instructions on packages you may need to have installed before the start of the block. If you never install a package before do not worry we are going to cover how to do it during the first day (Data Wrangling).
To facilitate the download of the material we also created ***Zipped File*** folder where you can find the blocks folders already zipped and ready to be downloaded.
Please **before** the module/s you are signed up for take place, download, unzip, and read the readme file of the block.

## Summer School Code of Cunduct

o    The summer school is meant to be interactive, and you will be prompted to replicate what the instructor is demonstrating on your own machine. 

o    Besides the instructors, there will be helpers present in the call who are there to help you if you get stuck or if you run into an error. Please be vocal about problems in the chat and someone will help you with addressing it. You may be asked to move to a breakout room if needed. During the introduction at the start of each block, we are going to cover how to ask for help in more detail. 

o    If you have a question, you can use the raise hand feature and we will notify the instructor. When you are not speaking, please mute yourself to avoid background noise. 

o    The instructors will ask questions that you can reply to either via chat or using the non-verbal indicators. We are going to show you where the non-verbal indicators are in the introduction, but you can find them clicking on the “Participants” tab, the same tab where the raise hand feature is.  

o    We promote an inclusive and welcoming environment, so we ask you to be respectful towards our instructors, helpers and fellow participants. Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated, and you will be asked to leave if it occurs.

## Summer School fundings

This initiative is funded by the Data-Driven innovation Initiative as part of their ‘Building Back Better’ open funding programme, helping to transform the City region into the data capital of Europe. It is supported by the Scottish Funding Council Covid-19 Recovery funding to the University of Edinburgh. The Scottish Funding Council has provided £75m funding to boost Scottish university research and to contribute to the mitigation of effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The University of Edinburgh received £23.2m of these funds.

One of the goals set by Scottish Funding Council is to fund translation of research into action, to support our region’s recovery. The University of Edinburgh has allocated £4m fund for this purpose, to be coordinated as part of the Data-Driven Innovation initiative. Through these activities, they aim to deliver impact for communities, services and businesses.
